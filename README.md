# An Introduction to Microservices with the Serverless Framework

We all want to build quality, scalable applications - fast. In this workshop you'll learn how to develop, deploy, debug, and monitor microservice APIs powering those applications using the Serverless Framework.

Starting with an empty Amazon Web Services account, you will quickly develop your own vote-counting microservice. The service will allow folks to vote for their favorite music and confirm the votes using a mobile phone.

After developing this application, you'll see how you can easily deploy it into multiple stages (development and production) and how you can setup deployment Safeguards on those stages with the Serverless Framework Dashboard.

After this, you'll see how to test and debug the API calls made to the microservice using the Serverless Dashboard to quickly resolve development issues.

From there, you'll deploy a simple frontend portion of the application using Serverless Components and by the end of the workshop you'll have a fully-functional web application with multiple stages, automatically instrumented with debugging tools and deployment best-practices.
